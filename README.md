- **Format:** CSV/Excel
- **Main Features:**
  - Brand
  - Screen Size
  - GPU Type
  - Operating System
  - Resolution
  - RAM Size
  - Processor Model
  - Price

## üìÇ Files Available
- [`laptop_prices.csv`](./laptop_prices.csv) - The dataset used for analysis.
- [`Google Colab Notebook`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PPja0Dtif_jE1hLwCC_R6b3IbXw_FZX_) - Run the analysis interactively.

## üìà Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Price Distribution by Screen Size**
- Shows the relationship between laptop screen sizes and pricing.
- Larger screens tend to have higher prices.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Average Laptop Weight by Brand**
- Compares the weight distribution across different laptop brands.
- NVIDIA GPUs are commonly used in high-end models.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Price by Operating System with Brand Breakdown**
- Highlights how OS choice affects pricing across brands.
- Windows laptops show the most variation in price.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Price Comparison Based on GPU Type**
- Demonstrates the pricing differences for laptops with different GPUs.
- High-end GPUs (Nvidia RTX 3090, 3080) are associated with higher prices.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Price Distribution by Resolution**
- Analyzes how screen resolution affects laptop pricing.
- Higher resolutions (3840x2160) correspond to more expensive models.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Impact of RAM Size & Processor Model on Price**
- Examines how RAM and CPU impact laptop prices.
- Larger RAM sizes generally lead to higher prices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Power BI Techniques Used
- **DAX Measures** for aggregations and custom calculations.
- **Power Query** for data transformation and cleaning.
- **Interactive Visualizations** to explore pricing trends dynamically.

## üèÜ Key Findings
- High-resolution laptops (4K) have significantly higher prices.
- NVIDIA RTX series GPUs drive up laptop costs.
- RAM and processor type impact price significantly, with AMD Ryzen and high RAM sizes increasing costs.
- macOS laptops tend to be priced higher compared to Windows and Linux alternatives.
